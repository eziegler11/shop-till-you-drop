# shop-till-you-drop
A full stack application that allows a user to browse electronics products and add/remove them from a shopping cart. Built using the MERN stack.

## Description
Shop Till You Drop was developed as a portfolio project that showcases my skills and knowledge with the development of a full stack application using the MERN stack. I built this app from the ground up and really enjoyed seeing it all come together. I learned a lot more about passing props, using context within React, as well as styling with Tailwind CSS. The overall process of putting an app together from start to finish is something that I really enjoy and it brings great satisfaction when you get to see the finished product.

## Installation

The steps to install my project are as follows:

- Clone or fork my code from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies
- Run "npm run seed" to insert the dummy data into MongoDB
- Run "npm run dev" to run the live preview of the app
- Run the server from the command line using "npm run start"
